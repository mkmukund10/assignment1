# CS-7641 Supervised Learning

URL for code
https://github.com/mkmukund10/assignment1

All data is stored under data folder and plots under plot folder.

This project implements the following 5 different learning algorithms on two different datasets:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Neural Networks
- Boosting (ADABoost)
- SVM
- k-nearest neighbors


## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies and running experiments
The implementation is done through jupyter notebook

Install anaconda for running the notebooks

```

You can also individually run the experiments by launching the notebooks using jupyter notebook console

```
For example - Adult Dataset

- Decision Tree Classifier: DecisionTree_adult.ipynb
- Neural Networks: NeuralNet_adult.ipynb
- Boosting (ADABoost): AdaBoost_adult.ipynb
- SVM: SVN_adult.ipynb
- k-nearest neighbors: KNN_adult.ipynb

```
